# About
Chakram Love is a project for Outward to rebalance the Chakrams and make them a more interesting and fun addition to your class builds. You can expect these changes from Chakram Love now;
- Mana Cost and Cooldown is cut in half for all Chakram Skills.
- Removed need of the Discipline Boon to cast the Skills.

More changes are planned and are coming to completely reinvent the Chakram Skills for New and Experienced Players alike to enjoy!

# Planned
- Nerf Chakram damage to account for change in Mana Cost and Cooldown Reduction
- Lower the price for Chakram weapons
- Add more effects for different Chakram
- Add a Chakram Trainer and Skill tree for more skills
- Add a Mainhand Chakram to pair with the Offhand Chakram
