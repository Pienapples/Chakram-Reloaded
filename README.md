# About
Chakram Reloaded is a project for Outward to rebalance the Chakrams and make them a more interesting and fun addition to your class builds. Adding new additions to the Chakram skills, more skills, Trainer, and Weapons!

More changes are planned and are coming to completely reinvent the Chakram Skills for New and Experienced Players alike to enjoy!

# Planned
- Nerf Chakram damage to account for change in Mana Cost and Cooldown Reduction.
- Lower the price for certain Chakram weapons.
- Add effects for different Chakrams.
- Add a Mainhand Chakram instead of being exclusively Off-Hand.
- Add a Chakram Trainer and Skill tree.
